*** 2. What are REST APIs? ***

### Understanding APIs and RESTful APIs

**What is an API?**

* API (Application Programming Interface) enables communication between a client and a server.
* Example: Checking shipment status on a website by entering a tracking ID.
* APIs allow programs to request data from servers directly using code, without a user interface.

**REST (Representational State Transfer):**

* A popular approach for designing APIs.
* Provides guidelines and rules on how APIs should be designed and behave.

---

### Key Concepts of RESTful APIs

1. **Endpoints (URI):**

   * Specific addresses on the server where requests are sent.
   * Example: `/shipment` endpoint for shipment status.

2. **Client and Server:**

   * Client: The program sending the API request.
   * Server: The machine receiving, processing the request, and sending the response.

3. **HTTP Methods:**

   * Common methods:

     * `GET`: Read data.
     * `POST`: Create new data.
     * `PUT`: Update existing data.
     * `DELETE`: Remove data.
   * The method indicates the action the client wants to perform on the resource.

4. **Request Components:**

   * **Headers:** Metadata such as data format or authentication info (key-value pairs).
   * **Body:** Data sent to the server, often in JSON format (key-value pairs).

     * Example: Sending a tracking ID in the request body to get shipment details.

---

### API Response

1. **Status Codes:**

   * Indicate the result of the request.
   * Examples:

     * `200 OK`: Successful request.
     * `400 Bad Request`: Client sent invalid data.
     * `404 Not Found`: Requested endpoint does not exist.
     * `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an error.
   * Status code ranges:

     * 200s: Success
     * 300s: Redirection
     * 400s: Client errors
     * 500s: Server errors

2. **Response Components:**

   * **Headers:** Information about the server or data format.
   * **Body:** The actual data requested, usually in JSON format.

     * Example: Shipment status details.

---

### Summary

* APIs enable programmatic communication between client and server.
* REST is a standard for designing APIs with defined endpoints, HTTP methods, and structured requests and responses.
* Clients send requests with methods, headers, and bodies; servers respond with status codes, headers, and data.
* RESTful APIs follow these principles to ensure consistent and predictable interactions.

*** 3. What is FastAPI?  ***
---

### Introduction to FastAPI

**What is FastAPI?**

* A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python.
* Developed by Sebastian Ramirez.
* Gaining popularity rapidly due to its speed and ease of use.

---

### Building APIs with FastAPI

1. **Creating an Endpoint:**

   * Start with a basic Python function.
   * Use a decorator to specify the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the request path (endpoint).
   * The function returns data, which FastAPI sends as the API response.

2. **Running the API Server:**

   * Once endpoints are defined, run the FastAPI server to accept requests and send responses.

3. **Decorator Syntax:**

   * Decorators link functions to specific API routes and methods.
   * May seem unfamiliar initially, but understanding them is essential for defining endpoints.

examples:
app3.py

---

### Key Features of FastAPI

* **Data Validation:** Automatically validate request and response data using Pydantic models.
* **Automatic API Documentation:** Generates interactive API docs based on OpenAPI standards.
* **Dependency Injection:** Manage components like database connections cleanly.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Supports async functions for efficient handling of many concurrent requests.

---

### Underlying Technologies

* **Starlette:** Handles the web server functionality.
* **Pydantic:** Manages data parsing and validation.

---

### Summary

FastAPI is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use Python framework designed to build scalable and well-structured APIs efficiently.
